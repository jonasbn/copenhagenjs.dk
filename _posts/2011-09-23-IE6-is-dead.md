We are pleased to announce, that in collaboration with **[Microsoft](http://microsoft.dk/)**, we can invite you to our **IE6 is dead event**.

<img src='/images/ie6_logo.png' alt='IE6 logo' align="center" />

As we all know the usage of IE6 has (thankfully) gone down the past years, due to a joint effort of everyone in the community.

Even Microsoft has helped by running campaigns to lower the usage of IE6. We all remember the **[IE6 countdown page](http://www.ie6countdown.com)**, right?.

Since the IE6 usage in Denmark is one of the lowest in the world, we are inviting you and your friends to celebrate this with us.

## The event

The agenda for the event is pretty simple. We want to network, talk old IE6 warstories, discuss how the browser landscape has changed in the recent years, and most importantly. Get drunk.

The **bar opens at 18:00**, and stays open until we are out of money. There should be **plenty of beer** for everyone, but if it's getting late, be prepared open your wallet.

To capture the event, our idea is to take a photo of all attendies who are holding a banner stating "IE6 is dead". So, to prepare yourself for the perfect action shot, think hard about your worst IE6 nightmare, and remember to recall it in the right moment.

The event is taking place on the **13th of October**, at **[Nørrebro Bryghus](http://prodata.dk/)**, Ryesgade 3, 2200 Købehavn N.

## RSVP

To get an indication of how many are attending, we have chosen to use Facebook, since this is a more "social" event than our regular events, so please visit [http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=270255216327858](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=270255216327858) and let us know if you're attending. Nothing is binding, we just need to know roughly how many drinks to prepare.
